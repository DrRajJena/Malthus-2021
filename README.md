# Malthus-2021
A Refresh of the Malthus Radiotherapy Demand Model.

The Malthus model is a radiotherapy demand simulation model for England, which was originally developed in 2011 to provide simulations for the demand for external beam radiotherapy treatment in adults if all patients were treated to the highest level of clinical evidence.

In this manuscript, we present a brief update on the model for 2021, focusing on changes to the clinical evidence for the 4 main tumour types in the model, namely Breast, Prostate, Head & Neck and Lung cancer.

Text versions of the clinical decision trees are shared, along with simulations for radiotherapy utilisation for the whole of England, and the 135 clinical commissioning groups that make up NHS England.
